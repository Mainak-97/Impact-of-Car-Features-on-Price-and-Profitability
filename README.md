# Overview

This project aims to explore how various car features affect pricing and profitability in the **automotive industry**. 

The focus is on identifying key attributes that influence a car's MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) and understanding the relationship between these attributes, market categories, and consumer preferences. 

The analysis is performed using a dataset containing specifications of over 11,000 car models, provided by **Cooper Union** and sourced from **Kaggle**.

The analysis was conducted using **Microsoft Excel**, employing advanced and statistical concepts to derive meaningful insights.
# Files Included

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains 16 variables for 11,159 car models. The variables include:

1. Make: Brand of the car
2. Model: Specific model of the car
3. Year: Year of manufacture
4. Engine Fuel Type: Type of fuel used (e.g., gasoline, diesel)
5. Engine HP: Horsepower of the engine
6. Engine Cylinders: Number of cylinders in the engine
7. Transmission Type: Type of transmission (automatic or manual)
8. Driven Wheels: Type of driven wheels (front, rear, or all)
9. Number of Doors: Number of doors in the car
10. Market Category: Market segment the car belongs to (e.g., Luxury, Performance)
11. Vehicle Size: Size of the car (Compact, Midsize, Large)
12. Vehicle Style: Body style of the car (e.g., Sedan, Coupe)
13. Highway MPG: Estimated miles per gallon on the highway
14. City MPG: Estimated miles per gallon in the city
15. Popularity: Popularity ranking based on online views
16. MSRP: Manufacturerâ€™s Suggested Retail Price
# Analysis Methodology

The analysis was performed in Excel and follows these steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Missing values were handled, and the dataset was formatted for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Key statistics and distributions were examined.

3. **Statistical Analysis:**

- Regression Analysis: Identified car features most strongly influencing the MSRP.
- Correlation Analysis: Examined relationships between variables, such as engine power and fuel efficiency.
- Pivot Tables & Charts: Used to summarize data and visualize trends.

4. **Market Segmentation:**  Analyzed how different market categories impact car popularity and pricing.

5. **Dashboard Creation:** An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to visualize key findings.


# Key Insights

- **Popularity vs. Market Category:** 

The "Flex Fuel" market category is the most popular, with "Crossover" closely following, although the latter has more car models.

- **Engine Power and Price:** 

There is a strong positive correlation between engine horsepower and car price; as horsepower increases, the MSRP also tends to rise.

- **Influential Features on Price:** 

Regression analysis revealed that engine cylinders, engine HP, and fuel type are the most significant factors affecting car price.

- **Manufacturer Pricing:** 

Luxury brands like Bugatti, Ferrari, and Rolls-Royce have the highest average MSRPs, while economy brands like Hyundai and Kia have the lowest.

- **Fuel Efficiency:** 

Cars with fewer engine cylinders generally have better fuel efficiency, as measured by highway MPG.
